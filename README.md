Advent of Code 2021, in aarch64 assembly!

I'm challenging myself to learn arm64 assembly. So far it's paid off. If you are an expert or have feedback, feel free to hit me up on twitter @chriseberly

To save my sanity, this is run through a C driver that handles reading the input file and displaying the output. But my goal is to write as much as possible in asm.

I wrote this on an x86 linux box using the aarch64 gcc packages as well as qemu. 

A great blog post that explains all this is: https://azeria-labs.com/arm-on-x86-qemu-user/

Happy hacking!
